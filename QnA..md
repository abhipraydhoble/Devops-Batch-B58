**1.Regular file:** A regular file is the most common type of file in Linux. It can contain text, binary data, images, or program code.

**2.Directory Files:** A directory is a special type of file that holds references to other files and directories. Directories organize files in a hierarchical structure.

**3.Symbolic (Soft) Link:** A symbolic link (symlink) is a file that points to another file or directory. It acts as a shortcut to another file or location.

### 19. Difference Hard Link vs Soft Link ?

**Softlink:** 

1)A separate file that contains a path.

2)A path to the target file.

3)If the target file is deleted,the softlink becomes a "dangling link" and is unusable.

**Hardlink:**

1)A reference to the inode

2)Same inode as the target file.

3)Even if the orignal file is deleted,the hardlink remains,and the data us not lost.**

### 20. How to change ownership of file/dir ?
````
chown username <file_name or dir_name>
````
### 21. How to set permissions using symbolic and numeric modes ?

**1. Symbolic Mode:**
In symbolic mode, permissions are specified using letters for users and operations to modify permissions.

Syntax of Symbolic Mode:
````
chmod [who][operation][permission] file
````
who: Defines the user(s) whose permissions are being changed. It can be:
- u: User (owner)
- g: Group
- o: Others (everyone else)
- a: All (user, group, and others)

operation: Defines the operation you want to perform:
- +: Add permission
- -: Remove permission
- =: Set exactly the specified permission, removing all others

permission: Defines the type of permission:
- r: Read
- w: Write
- x: Execute

Examples of Symbolic Mode:
Add execute permission for the owner:
````
chmod u+x file.txt
````
**2. Numeric (Octal) Mode:**
In numeric mode, permissions are represented as a three-digit octal number where each digit represents the permissions for the owner, group, and others. Each permission is assigned a number:
- Read (r) = 4
- Write (w) = 2
- Execute (x) = 1

The number is a sum of the values for the permissions:
- No permissions = 0
- Read-only = 4
- Write-only = 2
- Execute-only = 1
- Read + Write = 6 (4 + 2)
- Read + Execute = 5 (4 + 1)
- Write + Execute = 3 (2 + 1)
- Read + Write + Execute = 7 (4 + 2 + 1)
Syntax of Numeric Mode:
````
chmod [permissions] file
````
Examples of Numeric Mode:
Set permissions for owner as read/write, group as read, and others as read:
````
chmod 644 file.txt
````

Class B addresses are used by medium-sized networks, with a good balance between the number of networks and hosts.

**3.Class C**

IP Range: 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255

First Octet: 192 to 223

Purpose: Used for small networks (e.g., small businesses, home networks).

Number of Networks: 2,097,152 (2^21)

Number of Hosts per Network: 254 (2^8 - 2 for network and broadcast)

Class C addresses are the most common, often used in small networks, like home or office networks, because of the limited number of hosts per network.

**4.Class D (Multicast)**

IP Range: 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255

First Octet: 224 to 239

Purpose: Reserved for multicast addresses, used for one-to-many communication (e.g., video conferencing, streaming).

Number of Networks: N/A (These are special addresses, not for typical networking use)

Class D addresses are used for multicasting, where one source sends data to multiple recipients, such as in streaming or group communications.

**5.Class E (Reserved for Future Use)**

IP Range: 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255

First Octet: 240 to 255

Purpose: Reserved for experimental or future use by IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force). Not used for public addressing.

Class E addresses are reserved for future research and development purposes, and they are not typically used in actual networks.

**Example Range: Common private IP address ranges for IPv4 include:**

10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 (Class A)

172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 (Class B)

## 4. explain IAM service ?
### What is IAM?

**IAM stands for Identity and Access Management. It is a framework of policies and technologies used to ensure that the right individuals and entities in an organization have appropriate access to resources.
IAM services are crucial in cloud environments, allowing organizations to manage who can access what resources and under what conditions.**

### Key Features of IAM Services
#### Authentication
**Verifies the identity of users, devices, or services trying to access resources.
Methods include passwords, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and single sign-on (SSO).**

#### Authorization
**Determines what actions authenticated entities are allowed to perform on resources.
Access is granted based on roles, policies, or attributes.**

#### Granular Permissions
**Fine-tuned control over resources.
Permissions can be set for specific actions (e.g., read, write, delete) on specific resources.**

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
**Access is granted based on roles assigned to users (e.g., admin, developer, viewer).**

#### Policy Management
**Use of policies to define access rules. Policies can be attached to users, groups, or roles.**

#### Audit and Compliance
**Logs all access and activities for auditing purposes.
Ensures compliance with security and regulatory requirements.**

#### Federated Access
**Allows external identity providers (e.g., Google, Microsoft Azure AD) to authenticate users.**

### Why is IAM Important?
#### Security: **Prevents unauthorized access and protects sensitive data,**
#### Scalability: **Easily manage access for a growing number of users and resources.**
#### Compliance: **Helps organizations meet industry standards and regulatory requirements.**
#### Efficiency: **Streamlines access management processes.**

### Key Components of IAM Services
#### Users: **Individual identities that need access (e.g., employees, contractors).**
#### Groups: **Collections of users with similar permissions.**
#### Roles: **A set of permissions assigned to a user or group (e.g., Admin Role).**
#### Policies: **Rules that define what actions are allowed or denied.**
#### Resources: **The cloud assets (e.g., files, servers, databases) being accessed.**

### Popular IAM Services
#### AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)
**Allows secure access control to AWS services and resources.
Features include roles, policies, and MFA.**

#### Google Cloud IAM
**Manages access to Google Cloud resources with fine-grained permissions.**

#### Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)
**Provides identity management and access control for Microsoft Azure.**

#### Okta
**A third-party identity and access management platform offering SSO and MFA.**

#### Auth0
**Specializes in identity management for developers to build authentication into applications.**

### Real-World Use Cases
#### Role Assignment:
**Grant developers access to deploy code but restrict them from modifying production environments.**

#### MFA Enforcement:
**Require employees to authenticate with both a password and a mobile device**.

#### Temporary Access:
**Grant contractors access to a project for a limited time and automatically revoke it afterward.**

#### Auditing:
**Monitor and log who accessed critical resources and when.**

#### IAM is a cornerstone of secure and efficient cloud operations, ensuring that only the right users and services have access to the necessary resources while maintaining strong governance.

## 5. explain policies in IAM ?
### Types of IAM Policies

#### Managed Policies
**Predefined policies created and managed by the cloud provider or your organization.**
#### Two types:
#### AWS-Managed Policies (or similar in other clouds):**Generic, ready-to-use policies provided by the provider.**
#### Customer-Managed Policies: **Custom policies created and managed by users.**

#### Inline Policies
**Policies that are embedded directly within a user, group, or role.
Used for highly specific use cases.**

#### Service Control Policies (SCPs)
**Used in multi-account environments to set guardrails on what actions can be performed across accounts.**

#### Identity-Based Policies
**Attached to users, groups, or roles to define their access to resources.**

#### Resource-Based Policies
**Attached directly to a resource (e.g., an S3 bucket in AWS).
Useful for granting cross-account access.**

## 6. explain roles in IAM ?
### Roles in IAM (Identity and Access Management)
**A role in IAM is a set of permissions that define what actions an entity (a user, service, or application) can perform on resources. Unlike users, roles are not associated with a specific identity by default. Instead, roles are assumed by trusted entities when needed, enabling temporary and secure access to resources.**

### Types of IAM Roles
#### Service Roles
**Used by AWS services (or equivalent in other clouds) to perform actions on behalf of the user.
Example: An Amazon EC2 instance using a role to access S3**.

#### Cross-Account Roles
**Allows users or services in one account to access resources in another account.
Example: Account A granting Account B access to its S3 bucket.**

#### Application Roles
**Used by applications to securely access resources without embedding credentials in the code.
Example: A serverless application accessing a database using a role.**

#### Identity Provider Roles (Federated Roles)
**Used for integrating external identity providers (e.g., Google, Okta) for authentication.
Example: Employees using corporate SSO to assume roles in AWS.**
